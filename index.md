I am Rajesh Ramesh, from India.

I am an active user of open-source CFD software like Nek (Nek5000,NekRS) and OpenFOAM. I was introduced to Nek during my PhD research at Arizona State University (ASU).
What I like about Nek is the scalability to run very large simulations on GPUs and CPUs and the idea of open-source is to build on top of it any additonal modules.
For my PhD, I am using Nek5000 to simulate problems relevant in geophysics like dust devils and dust entrainment mechanisms.
